This is my diploma work on Skillbox course "Layout" and my personal portfolio site.

# Layout
I used new HTML5 features like semantic elements. All CSS code is written by BEM methodology and with SASS preprocessor. CSS code for each independent block of page was written to separate file, so you can modify css easy and fast.

I also used Bottstrap 4 columns for some blocks of page.

# Adaptivity
I used @media queries, bootstrap columns and containers to make all elements of page displayed in right way on every screen size
