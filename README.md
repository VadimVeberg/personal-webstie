This is my diploma work on Skillbox course "Layout" and my personal portfolio site.

# Layout
I used new **HTML5** features like semantic elements. All CSS code is written by **BEM** methodology and with **SASS** preprocessor. CSS code for each independent block of page considered to separate file, so you can easy and fast modify css.
